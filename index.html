                    Natasha Romanoff was trained from a young age to cultivate a very specific set of skills in a Russian facility called the Red Room.
                    There she honed the skills that would turn her into a human warrior who continues to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with super soldiers, Asgardians and people in armored suits.
                    However, she eventually eschewed her KGB masters, switched allegiances and began working for the good guys.

                    Exhibiting no super human abilities, the Black Widow boasts ultimate human levels of strength, agility, and stamina.
                    She is extensively trained to near perfection in a variety of fighting styles, such as karate, judo, kung fu, and wrestling, and with all manner of weapons—both traditional and high-tech—combined with her background in gymnastics, acrobatics, and ballet to always accomplish her mission.
              

                <p>
                    She can use a simple handgun just as well as a Chitauri battle staff or even Captain America's shield.
                    Her signature weapons include dual batons, a pair of Glock 26s and the Black Widow’s Bite—bracelets that discharge electricity.
                    Romanoff also displays great skill when it comes to hacking in computers and technological systems to dig for information or regaining control.

                    A bite from a spider somehow granted teenager Peter Parker its arachnid abilities and instead of using them for personal gain, he decided to help others with them. An orphan living with his aunt, May Parker, the boy chose to wear a mask while fighting crime so as not to burden her with his actions.</p>
    
                <p>
                    Calling himself Spider-Man and sporting a pair of web-shooting devices he’d constructed, Parker wound up in internet videos which attracted the attention of Tony Stark.
                    The billionaire industrialist deduced Spider-Man’s secret identity and approached Parker at his and May’s home in Queens, New York with a request for aid from the hero in an upcoming confrontation with Captain America and a group of other rogue Avengers and associates.
                    Parker was initially hesitant to even admit his secret career as Spider-Man, but the thrill of adventure and Stark’s talk of responsibility drew him in and he accepted the invitation, as well as a new, high-tech costume and web-shooters.

                    Born 1500 years ago to Odin and Frigga, the king and queen of fabled Asgard, Thor grew into a mighty warrior and protector of his home and people.
                    Thought to be rash and even reckless by his father, Thor nevertheless looked forward to the day of his ascension to the throne.
                    But, his adoptive brother Loki schemed in private to ensure that day never arrived. He manipulated Thor into attacking the Frost Giants, legendary adversaries of the Asgardians and Loki’s people, and Odin—hoping to teach his son humility—divested Thor of his magic hammer Mjolnir and banished him to Midgard, the realm also known as Earth.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Alone and unable to return to Asgard, Thor met scientists Jane Foster and Erik Selvig in the midst of their investigation into strange activity near a small New Mexico town.
                    While his brother struggled with the limitations of mortals on Earth, Loki worked to ensure his own seizure of the Asgardian throne and planned to allow the Frost Giant king—his real father—into Asgard to slay Odin in his sleep.
                    Back on Earth, Thor sacrificed himself to save the town from destruction and in doing so, impressed Odin enough to restore him to full Asgardian power.

                    Genius inventor Tony Stark continued his father Howard Stark’s weaponry business after his parents’ untimely deaths and flew it to even greater heights of innovation.
                    While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile for the U.S. military, Stark’s convoy came under fire by a terrorist group known as the Ten Rings and he was severely wounded.
                    Taken prisoner by the group, Stark awoke in their headquarters to learn that shrapnel near his heart had nearly cost him his life, but swift action by scientist and fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen—who had inserted a powerful electromagnet in Stark’s chest—would prolong it temporarily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stalling his captors after they demanded he build them a new weapon, Stark replaced the magnet with the RT, a miniature version of a device originally designed by his father, the Arc Reactor.
                    Furthermore, he and Yinsen created a crude suit of armor which could provide them the means with which to escape.
                    The suit worked as planned, though Yinsen sacrificed himself in order to allow Tony enough time to power it up to fight their terrorist captors.

                    Very little is known about the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent known as Hawkeye or his origins.
                    An accomplished combatant and weapons master, he was present for Thor’s arrival on Earth, and was impressed with the God of Thunder.
                    He was also instrumental in bringing over Natasha Romanoff, AKA Black Widow, to the side of S.H.I.E.L.D, sparing her life and offering her a path to redemption.

                    For his extraordinary abilities, he was recruited by Nick Fury to be part of the Avengers Initiative.
                    Unfortunately, in his first mission with the Avengers, he initially worked against them, thanks his mind being controlled by Loki, the Asgardian God of Mischief.
                    After being broken free, however, the horrified Clint did work alongside his fellow Super Heroes to bring down the trickster god.

                    Since then, he has managed to put his talents to good use against the Chitauri, Ultron, HYDRA, and even his fellow Avengers when it seemed necessary.

                        Bioscience genius Dr. Bruce Banner focused his major studies on the effects of gamma radiation on humans, working alongside Dr. Betty Ross at a Virginia University lab.
                        Dr. Ross’ father, General “Thunderbolt” Ross of the U.S. Army, channeled Banner’s work into a program to develop weapons for the military, unbeknownst to both doctors.
                        When Banner decided to test what he learned on himself, he triggered a fantastic transformation in himself that resulted in an immense, hulking figure fueled by his own rage.
                    </span>

                    Having destroyed his lab as the creature, and inadvertently harming Ross in the process, Banner slipped away to avoid capture and study by the Army and began a desperate quest for a cure to his bizarre affliction.

                    Envious of his friend Bucky Barnes’ military enlistment, and undeterred by his own multiple rejections by the U.S. Army, physical weakling Steve Rogers made one more attempt to join the march of men to fight for their country in the dark days of World War II. Rogers’ valiant wish to fight bullies wherever they were grabbed the attention of scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine, and he handpicked the idealistic young man for the Army’s Super-Soldier program under his supervision.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Though Rogers learned of Erskine’s disastrous previous attempts to realize a super-soldier, Germany’s so-called “Red Skull,” he braved the process and emerged from it a new man.
                    With a powerful body and heightened speed and reflexes, Rogers faced his first challenge when forced to chase down Dr. Erskine’s assassin immediately following the experiment.
                    In doing so, he also learned of the involvement of Hydra, the Nazi science division, in the doctor’s murder.

                <p>
                    The Army moved swiftly to create a colorful, star-spangled persona for Steve Rogers they called “Captain America,” and put him on a tour to sell war bonds.
                    Chafing at what he felt was inaction, Rogers jumped at the chance to join the real fighting when he received news of the capture of his friend Barnes’ army division and rushed to rescue the soldiers.
                    Upon the successful completion of the unplanned mission—and a brief meeting with the Red Skull himself—Rogers determined his path as a one-man fighting force.
